title: 'Inferring Mental States from Disfluencies'
excerpt: "Delays and disfluencies (“um”) are ubiquitous in everyday conversation and often signal rich information about what’s going on inside a speaker’s mind. How—and how quickly—something is said can be as meaningful as what is said. In this line of work, I investigate how children (and adults) use disfluencies to infer a speaker’s underlying mental processes. My research explores how children use these cues to reason about just how much someone knows and what their true underlying feelings are. In this work, I argue that children's reasoning about delays and disfluencies is inferential (vs. heuristic), broad (vs. limited), and flexible (vs. fixed).<img src='/images/umm-stimuli.png' style='display: block; width: 50%; margin: auto;'>"

Delays and disfluencies ("um") are a ubiquitous part of everyday conversation. Far from being meaningless noise, they can reveal rich information about what is happening inside a speaker’s mind. In this line of work, I examine how children (and adults) use disfluencies to infer a speaker’s mental states and figure out about how much someone knows, how confident they are, or what they truly believe.

I argue that children’s reasoning about disfluency is not merely heuristic, but inferential: broad, flexible, and context-sensitive. Rather than applying a simple rule, children adaptively interpret these subtle cues depending on conversational context.

In one series of studies, children as young as 4 inferred that disfluent speakers were less knowledgeable when making factual claims (even when accurate), but blocked this inference when speakers openly expressed ignorance. When discussing preferences, 6-year-olds inferred that disfluent speakers held weaker preferences, and flexibly generalized the meaning of disfluency across these different conversational contexts.
