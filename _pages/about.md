Everday conversation is a ubiquitous testbed of mental-state reasoning. Broadly, I am interested in how children rely on and exploit social reasoning in conversational contexts. To become smooth conversationalists, young children must learn to extract social information from language to learn about people, and also recruit social information to learn language. In much of my work, I explore how children infer social meaning not from *what* someone says, but from *how* (and especially how quickly) they say it. Methodologically, I rely on behavioral experiments with adults and children, corpus analysis, and computational modeling.

Currently, I am a postdoc at Yale University working with Julian Jara-Ettinger at the [Computational Social Cognition Lab](https://compdevlab.yale.edu/).

Prior to coming to Yale, I received my PhD student in Developmental Psychology from the University of Chicago in 2024. I worked with Alex Shaw at the [DIBS Lab](https://www.dibslab.uchicago.edu/), and also Dan Yurovsky at the [Communication and Learning Lab](https://callab.uchicago.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. I received my BA in Psychology from Reed College.

<!--- Broadly, I am interested in the intersection between language and social cognition across development. My current work explores the language cues that children use to infer others' mental-states, as well as how children adapt their language to a listener's mental-state. Methodologically, I rely on behavioral experiments with adults and children, corpus analysis, and computational modeling. -->
