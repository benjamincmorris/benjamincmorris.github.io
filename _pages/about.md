**Note: ** This site is under construction.

I am a third year doctoral student in Developmental Psychology at the University of Chicago. I work with Alex Shaw at the [DIBS Lab](https://www.dibslab.uchicago.edu/) and Dan Yurovsky at the [Communication and Learning Lab](https://callab.uchicago.edu/). 

Broadly, I am interested in the intersection between language and social cognition across development. My current work explores the language cues that children use to infer others' mental-states, as well as how children adapt their language to a listener's mental-state. Methodologically, I rely on behavioral experiments with adults and children, corpus analysis, and computational modeling.

Prior to coming to the University of Chicago, I worked with [Claire Hughes](https://www.cfr.cam.ac.uk/directory/ClaireHughes) at the University of Cambridge and [Jennifer Henderlong Corpus](https://www.reed.edu/psychology/faculty/corpus.html) at Reed College.
