Every time we talk to someone, we're tasked with reasoning about their mind. Often our key insights come not from _what_ they say, but _how_ they say it. Imagine asking a friend what they think of your new haircut. Sure, their words will matter. But you might learn more about what they really think from the pause before they speak, their puzzled facial expression, or the way they say, “it’s… different.”

In my research, I study how subtle conversational cues — like disfluencies, delays, and surprise — reveal mental processes behind what people say, leading people to draw rich inferences about what others' know, like, and believe. These inferences help us navigate communication, evaluate others, and learn from social interaction. 

Much of my work focuses on the development of such inferences in early childhood, and how they guide social learning. I also examine how adults use these signals to reason about others in real time. Methodologically, I integrate behavioral experiments, corpus analysis, and computational modeling to study these inference processes.





I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Yale University, working with Julian Jara-Ettinger at the <a href="https://compdevlab.yale.edu/">Computational Social Cognition Lab</a>. I completed my PhD working with Alex Shaw at the <a href="https://www.dibslab.uchicago.edu/">DIBS Lab</a> at UChicago and Dan Yurovsky at the <a href="https://callab.uchicago.edu/">Communication and Learning Lab</a> at Carnegie Mellon University.

<!-- Everyday conversation is a ubiquitous testbed of mental-state reasoning. Broadly, I am interested in how children rely on and exploit social reasoning in conversational contexts. To become smooth conversationalists, young children must learn to extract social information from language to learn about people, and also recruit social information to learn language. In much of my work, I explore how children infer social meaning not from *what* someone says, but from *how* (and especially how quickly) they say it. Methodologically, I rely on behavioral experiments with adults and children, corpus analysis, and computational modeling.

<!--- Broadly, I am interested in the intersection between language and social cognition across development. My current work explores the language cues that children use to infer others' mental-states, as well as how children adapt their language to a listener's mental-state. Methodologically, I rely on behavioral experiments with adults and children, corpus analysis, and computational modeling. -->
