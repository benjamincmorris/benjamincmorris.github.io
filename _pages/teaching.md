Teaching is not one-size-fits-all. As such, my approach to teaching is fundamentally adaptive: I strive to meet students where they are, tailoring my teaching to their diverse needs, backgrounds, and goals. Across courses in developmental, social, and cognitive psychology, I aim to build intellectually vibrant spaces that engage students in both foundational theories and contemporary debates.

Informed by my interdisciplinary background—including psychology, sociology, linguistics, and computer science—I encourage students to see how core psychological processes unfold in real-world social contexts. I believe that effective teaching combines rigor with reflection: teaching should not only transmit knowledge, but cultivate curiosity, flexible thinking, and critical engagement with science as a practice.

# Leadership in Pedagogy & Mentorship

Beyond classroom teaching, I have actively worked to create new spaces for learning about teaching itself. In graduate school, I co-founded and co-organized a cross-departmental organization addressing the *hidden curriculum* of graduate education. This group—now in its fifth year—provides a forum for open science practices, equity discussions, professional development, and pedagogical reflection. We also developed an annual workshop on integrating open science into undergraduate curricula.

In addition to this broader pedagogical leadership, I have extensive experience mentoring students across multiple levels. Throughout my graduate training, I served as an ongoing mentor to junior graduate students, providing support on research, writing, conference presentations, and navigating graduate life. I have served on multiple departmental committees focused on graduate student affairs and was elected President of the Psychology Graduate Student Organization at the University of Chicago. 

I have also mentored numerous undergraduate research assistants in the lab, helping to train students in experimental methods, data analysis, and research presentation. Several of these students completed independent research projects, honors theses, and went onto graduate study in psychology and related fields.

# Pedagogical Training

I am committed to ongoing development as a teacher. In my view, teaching is fundamentally a *practice*, and as such I am passionate about integrating feedback from students and colleagues, continuing to develop my own pedagogical skills, and building community around the critical reflection of pedagogical practices. I have completed extensive coursework, workshops, and teaching consultations. I am especially interested in cultivating my skills in equitable teaching, inclusive practices, and modern pedagogical innovations—including creative applications of AI and gamification. I have also worked as a Teaching Consultant myself, partnering with professors to provide feedback on their courses.
