In my teaching career, I have helped develop and teach courses related to developmental, social, and cognitive psychology. My research and background span a broad array of subfields in psychology and I take interdisplinary perspective that incorporates work from related fields (including sociology, linguistics, and computer science). As a teacher, I start from the assumption that teaching should be fundamentally adaptive, and that a student-centered approach is crucial to meet the needs of each learner. 

I have also sought to create new spaces for learning and for learning about teaching. In graduate school at the University of Chicago, I co-founded and co-organized a new organization (now running for more than 5 years) that promotes discussion of the so-called hidden curriculum of graduate school and doing science more broadly. Among other topics, the group filled a void in the extant curriculum by covering contemporary open science practices and debates, and I also helped facilitate an annual event focused on how to incorproate those topics into our undergraduate teaching.

# Pedagogical Training

In my view, teaching is fundamentally a *practice*, and as such I am passionate about integrating feedback from students and colleagues, continuing to develop my own pedagogical skills, and building community around the critical reflection of pedagogical practices. I have participated in a number of courses and workshops aimed on college teaching, especially concerning equitable teaching practices and modern teaching approaches (e.g., gamefication, the role of AI). I have also worked as a Teaching Consultant partnering with professors to provide feedback on their courses, as well as completing observations and analyses of my own teaching practices in real time.

- Equitable Teaching in the Socials Sciences and Humanities (10 wk course, Yale)
- CCTE 50000: Course Design and College Teaching (Semester course, UChicago)
